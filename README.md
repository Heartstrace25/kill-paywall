### Sites with limited number of free articles
The free article limit can normally be bypassed by removing cookies for the site.*

Install the [Cookie Remover](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/cookie-remover/kcgpggonjhmeaejebeoeomdlohicfhce) extension.

When coming across a paywall click the cookie icon to remove the cookies then refresh the page.

_*May not always succeed_

### New site requests
Only large or major sites will be considered.
1. Visit an article on the site you want to bypass the paywall for and copy the article title.
2. Open up a new incognito window (Ctrl+Shift+N) and paste the article title into Google.
3. Click on the same article from the Google search results page. If it loads without a paywall you can [submit a request](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome/issues/new) to add the site, otherwise my extension cannot bypass it either.

Usually premium articles cannot be bypassed as they are behind a hard paywall.

### Troubleshooting
* This extension works best alongside [uBlock Origin](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublock-origin/cjpalhdlnbpafiamejdnhcphjbkeiagm).
* If a site doesn't work, try turning off uBlock and refreshing. Also try reinstalling the extension.
* Make sure the site is checked under Options (on macOS sometimes the sites are unselected).
* Make sure you're running the last version of Bypass Paywalls. 
* If none of these work, you can submit an issue [here](https://github.com/iamadamdev/bypass-paywalls-chrome/issues).

### Pull Requests
* PRs are welcome.

### Show your support
* I am not asking for donations or anything like that, all I ask is that you star this repo.
